# M1 - Applied Math in Games: Projectile Game (FA1.2)

An enhanced Unity 3D project building upon FA1.1, demonstrating projectile motion, transformations, and interactive gameplay with enemies and scoring.

## Features
- Player-controlled shooter with camera-relative movement (WASD)
- Projectile system using Rigidbody physics
- Moving and pulsating enemies (vector and scaling transformations)
- Enemies disappear and respawn after being hit
- Real-time score counter updates with each successful hit
- Simple, minimalistic environment for clarity and focus

## How to Play
1. Move the shooter using **WASD** keys.  
2. Press **Spacebar** or **Left Mouse Button** to shoot projectiles.  
3. Hit the enemies to score points — they’ll disappear and respawn after a short delay.

## Project Overview
- Demonstrates **vector movement**, **matrix-based transformations**, and **applied physics** in a game context.
- Implements **instantiation**, **collisions**, **scaling**, and **UI updates** via C# scripting.
